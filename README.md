# AN2DL Competitions
Repository containing the solutions of the competitions I participated in during the course of Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning at Politecnico di Milano.

## 1st challenge
This is a classification challenge. The goal is to design a neural network able to distinguish whether all, none, or some people in an input picture are wearing mask [link 1](https://www.kaggle.com/c/artificial-neural-networks-and-deep-learning-2020).

## 2nd challenge
This is an image segmentation challenge. The goal is to decide wheter a certain pixel of an input image representing a crop belongs to the actual crop category, to the background, or to the weed class. If the pixel is categorized as weed means that it can be cut [link 2](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/27176).

## 3rd challenge
This is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) challenge. Given a dictionary of possible answers, a dataset containing images and questions regarding the images, the model should answer using one response from the dictionary [link 3](https://www.kaggle.com/c/anndl-2020-vqa).
